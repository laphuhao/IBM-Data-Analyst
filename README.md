# IBM Data Visualization with Python

One of the most important skills of successful data scientists and data analysts is the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. In this course, I learned many ways to effectively visualize both small and large-scale data. I can take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that conveys insights. 

This course taught me to work with many Data Visualization tools and techniques. I have learned to create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts like: Waffle Charts, Area Plots, Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots, Word Clouds, Choropleth Maps, and many more! I also created interactive dashboards that allow even those without any Data Science experience to better understand data, and make more effective and informed decisions.

I have learned hands-on by completing numerous labs and a final project to practice and apply the many aspects and techniques of Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebooks and a Cloud-based IDE. I used several data visualization libraries in Python, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & Dash.

# IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate

Data analysis is the process of collecting, storing, modeling, and analyzing data that can inform executive decision-making, and the demand for skilled data analysts has never been greater.

This program taught me about the foundational data skills employers are seeking for entry-level data analytics roles. It is not only help me start my career in data analytics, but also provides a strong foundation for future career development in other paths such as data science, artificial intelligence, deep learning, or data engineering.

I learned the latest skills and tools used by professional data analysts including Excel spreadsheets, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebooks, Cognos Analytics, and more. I worked with a variety of data sources and project scenarios to gain practical experience with data manipulation and applying analytical skills.

I have completed the full program and I had a portfolio of projects and a Professional Certificate from IBM to showcase my expertise.

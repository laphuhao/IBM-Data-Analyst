# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.

In this course I have learned SQL inside out from the very basics of Select statements to advanced concepts like JOINs. 
I have: 
- writed foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
- filtered result sets, used WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses 
- differentiated between DML & DDL 
- CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables 
- used string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions
- built sub-queries and queried data from multiple tables 
- accessed databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python
- worked with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs through hands-on labs and projects

I have practiced building SQL queries, worked with real databases on the Cloud, and used real data science tools. 

In the final project I have analyzed multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate my skills.

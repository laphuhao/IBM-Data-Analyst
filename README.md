# Data Analysis with Python

Analyzing data with Python is an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. This course took me from the basics of data analysis with Python to building and evaluating data models.

Topics covered include:  
- collecting and importing data 
- cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
- data frame manipulation 
- summarizing data 
- building machine learning regression models 
- model refinement 
- creating data pipelines 

I have learned how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. I have predicted future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and have learned how to evaluate them.

In addition to video lectures I have learned and practiced using hands-on labs and projects. I have worked with several open source Python libraries, including Pandas and Numpy to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. I have also worked with scipy and scikit-learn, to build machine learning models and make predictions.

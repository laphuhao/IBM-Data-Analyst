# Data Analyst Capstone Project

By completing this final capstone project I have applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. I have assumed the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.  

I have performed the various tasks that professional data analysts do as part of their jobs, including: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualization with different charts and plots, and 
- Interactive dashboard creation. 

The project has culminated with a presentation of my data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report included an executive summary, my analysis, and a conclusion. I have assessed on both my work for the various stages in the Data Analysis process, as well as the final deliverable. 

As part of this project I have demonstrated my proficiency with using Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Relational Databases (RDBMS), Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos, and Python Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and others.

This project is a great addition to my portfolio and an opportunity to showcase my Data Analytics skills to prospective employers.
